# A 60-minute Gluon Crash Course

Gluon is an imperative API for MXNet thatâ€™s flexible and easy-to-use, and this course aims to give you a quick overview of the core Gluon concepts so you'll be ready to use it in your next projects.

Once you've completed the course, you should be able to:

1. Understand how to use the major components of Gluon
2. Define and train a basic neural network to classify images

We also provide a supplementary [YouTube video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkEvNnRk8uVmVKRDgznk3o3LxmjFRaW7s) that walks you through each of the chapters.

## Prerequisites
This course assumes that readers have basic knowledge about machine learning and neural networks.

For a high-level introduction to neural networks, you might find Andrew Ng's [Coursera class on Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) useful for acquiring the basic neural networking knowledge.

You can also refer to these
[excellent hands-on tutorials](http://gluon.mxnet.io/) to learn deep learning from scratch.

Some of the material might stray a little too far into advanced mathematics, but don't be concerned. You can still learn to use neural networks and Gluon without a PhD.

## Setup
For instructions on running the Jupyter notebooks included with this course, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/mli/gluon-crash-course/blob/master/README.md). Otherwise, you can simply read through this course's material.
