# A 60-minute Gluon Crash Course

This crash course aims to provide a quick overview of how to use Gluon, the imperative interface of MXNet.

When you finish this Gluon crash course, you will have accomplished the following goals:

1. Understanding the basic usage of the major components of Gluon
2. How to train a a basic neural network to predict images


## Prerequisites
This course assumes that readers have basic knowledge about machine learning and neural networks.

For a high-level introduction to neural networks, you might find [neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) helpful.

Otherwise, please refer to these
[excellent hands-on tutorials](http://gluon.mxnet.io/) to learn deep learning from scratch. Some of the material might stray a little to far into advanced mathematics, but don't be concerned. You can still learn Gluon without a PhD.
