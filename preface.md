# Preface

This course assumes that readers have basic knowledge about machine learning and neural networks. For a high-level introduction to neural networks, you might find Andrew Ng's [Coursera class on Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) useful for acquiring the basic neural networking knowledge. You can also refer to these
[excellent hands-on tutorials](http://gluon.mxnet.io/) to learn deep learning from scratch.

Some of the material might stray a little too far into advanced mathematics, but don't be concerned. You can still learn to use neural networks and Gluon without a PhD.

## Setup

This course requires Jupyter notebooks and MXNet v1.2.1 or a newer
version. Please refer to "Install a different MXNet package" section or how to install
various MXNet versions. For instructions on running the Jupyter notebooks
included with this course, please refer to the
[README](https://github.com/mli/gluon-crash-course/blob/master/README.md). Otherwise,
you can simply read through this course's material.

We also provide a supplementary
[YouTube video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkEvNnRk8uVmVKRDgznk3o3LxmjFRaW7s)
that walks you through each of the chapters. Note that these videos are based on
[version 0.1](https://github.com/mli/gluon-crash-course/releases/tag/v0.1). A newer
version may be slightly different.

## Acknowledgments

1. The idea to provide a short tutorial like this is from [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html).
1. A large amount of content is adapted from [Deep Learning - The Straight Dope](http://gluon.mxnet.io/).
